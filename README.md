# CyberSecurity Through Protection
Project 2
1. Implementation with an Access Matrix
2. Implementation with an Access List of Objects
3. Implementation with Capability Lists for Domains

For each run, the program should dynamically generate N and M, and populate the access matrix randomly as well. That is, randomly generate N and M to exist in the range [3,7].
